-------------------------

Redmine-Mylyn integration for Eclipse allows you to manage your Redmine issues straight from Eclipse.

Using the integration you can:

* create and update issues
* comment, reassign or close issues
* filter issues based on the their attributes
* receive notifications on new or updated issues

Installation
-------------------------

Redmine-Mylyn integration requires 2 components to work:

1. Redmine plugin (connector) - is installed inside Redmine server and publishes an API
2. Eclipse plugin - acts like a client for API from (1) plugin

The Mylyn project in particular has always called the component that adds support for another server a "connector", 
and Redmine usually calls additional components "plugin" - alas, 
the original software project got this the wrong way around and called the server-side component a connector
and the client side component a plugin. Confusion persists unto this day.

Connector Installation
-------------------------

1. Install connector inside Redmine server
    
    For Redmine 2.x install Connector from:
    [http://danmunn.github.io/redmine_mylyn_connector/](http://danmunn.github.io/redmine_mylyn_connector/)
     
    For Redmine 3.x install Connector from:
    [https://github.com/joaopedrotaveira/redmine_mylyn_connector](https://github.com/joaopedrotaveira/redmine_mylyn_connector#installation)
     
2. Enable REST API in Redmine server

    This is required, because Eclipse plugin uses REST API to authenticate user and perform requests. 

    To enable REST API go to yours redmine Administration -> Settings -> Authentication tab and toggle on:
    **Enable REST web service** and press **Save**

Plugin Installation
-------------------------

1.  Download latest release from GitHub releases:
[ZIP with built plugin as P2 repo](https://github.com/YSavanier/redmine-mylyn-plugin/releases/0.5.2)

2.  Install it into Eclipse using instructions from [http://stackoverflow.com/a/16074606/498096](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16074606/498096) section "(1) auto install" - in summary:

		Eclipse Menu -> Help -> Install New Software -> Add -> Archive

		and then choose downloaded .zip file

3. Add Task Repository of type Redmine and provide redmine Url with Login and Password

Troubleshooting
-------------------------

To manipulate log levels for plugin classes, place your logback.xml file in following path:

		{workspace}/.metadata/.plugins/net.sf.redmine_mylyn.common/logback.xml

In your custom logback.xml you can denote log file location using:

		<file>${rmc.logfile}</file>
		or
		<file>${rmc.logdir}/redmine_connector_monday.log</file>
In both cases the log file will be created next to your logback.xml file, only the log filename will be different.
FYI HTTP traffic is not logged through SLF4j/Logback, since http-commons-3.x uses Common Logging
and the "jcl-over-slf4j" jar is not attached to this plugin.

Sample logback.xml content

	<configuration>
		<appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
			<file>${rmc.logfile}</file>
			<layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
				<Pattern>%date %level %logger{10} %msg%n</Pattern>
			</layout>
		</appender>
		<logger name="net.sf.redmine_mylyn" level="DEBUG" >
			<appender-ref ref="FILE" />
		</logger>
	</configuration>
